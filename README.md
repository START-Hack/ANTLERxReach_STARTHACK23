## <p align="center"> Case Introduction: </p>

Welcome to the "AI Voice Chat" Hackathon, where we invite you to build a voice chat bot that can reduce loneliness among the elderly by using a TV device. As the elderly population grows, many seniors experience social isolation and loneliness, which has negative effects on their mental and physical health. The voice chat bot you will create should provide encounters to help alleviate feelings of loneliness and improve the overall well-being of the elderly. In this hackathon, you can create a tool that can help reduce loneliness for the elderly. Let's collaborate to develop a technology that can truly make a difference in the lives of seniors.
